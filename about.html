            <p>Hello! I’m Udani Amasha, a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Science undergraduate 
              at the University of Westminster. I’m driven by curiosity about how technology shapes the way we live,
              connect, and evolve as a society. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development, 
              algorithms, and data structures, while also inspiring me to think critically about the ethical and social 
              dimensions of innovation.</p>

            <p>Beyond the classroom, I explore the intersection of code, culture, and ethics through my personal blog, “Social & Tech.”
               I’m deeply committed to creating technology that is not only functional and innovative, but also accessible, ethical, 
               and human-centered. Whether I’m writing code, reflecting on AI’s social impact, or learning something new, 
               I strive to grow as a thoughtful developer and lifelong learner dedicated to positive digital change.</p>
