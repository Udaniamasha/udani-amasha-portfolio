        <section class="single-post-content">
            <p>When we talk about green technology, the conversation often stops at energy efficiency. Lower power consumption,
                better batteries, and smarter charging all matter, but sustainability runs much deeper than electricity bills. The
                future of tech will be shaped not just by how little energy devices use, but by how long they last, how easily they
                can be fixed, and how responsibly they are made.</p>
            
            <p>For years, the tech industry has quietly relied on planned obsolescence. Devices are designed to age quickly, slow
                down, or become incompatible, nudging users toward constant upgrades. This approach fuels innovation on the surface,
                but underneath it creates mountains of electronic waste and drains natural resources. What looks like progress often
                comes at an invisible environmental cost.</p>
            
            <p>A genuinely sustainable approach demands a shift in how products are imagined from the start. Devices should be built
                to be repaired, not replaced. Parts should be accessible, instructions transparent, and upgrades possible without
                buying an entirely new product. Modular designs give users control over their technology and reduce the pressure to
                discard perfectly functional devices.</p>
            
            <p>Sustainability also extends beyond the product itself. Ethical sourcing of materials, fair labor practices, and
                responsible recycling must become standard, not optional. A circular economy, where old electronics are broken down
                and reborn into new ones, turns waste into opportunity rather than burden.</p>
            
            <p>In the years ahead, innovation will be measured differently. Speed and style will still matter, but they will no
                longer be enough. The companies that truly lead the future of technology will be those that design for longevity,
                responsibility, and respect for the world their products exist in.</p>
